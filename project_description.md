#####Description of Bead Tag Reward Program#####

After completion of every swim meet, RMSC swimmers on the Advanced Junior Team are given individual beads by their coaches to add to their bag tags.  Each bead they are given has been assigned a certain color that relates to a certain swimming stroke.  There are also beads representing if they acheived a "best time" as well as beads that represent a Junior Olympic cut time.  For special qualifying meets, they can also earn a bonus bead representing that specific meet.  The reasoning behind the bead reward system is not only to enourage the swimmers to try different strokes instead of "specializing" but also to show that they ARE making progress by continually adding to their bead tag.

The purpose of this javascript is to track the beads each swimmer has earned as well as to determine if a race time was better than a previous time and thus earning a "best time" bead.  It will also alert when a swimmer has passed a Junior Olympic cut time.
