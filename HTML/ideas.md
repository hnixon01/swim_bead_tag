##HTML Design ideas##

###One page per swimmer###
*Blank template to start - bubbles for diff. races
  *Bead bubble filled in as event swam throughout season
  *IF JO time is acheived, add star on left of bead bubble
  *every PB (personal best) a silver star will be placed to the right of bead bubble
