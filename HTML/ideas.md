##HTML Design ideas##

###One page per swimmer###
* Blank template to start - bubbles for diff. races
  * Bead bubble filled in as event swam throughout season (one event bead per season)
  * IF JO time is acheived, add star on left of bead bubble (only 1 JO star allowed, even if time is lowered)
  * every PB (personal best) a silver star will be placed to the right of bead bubble (unlimited)
